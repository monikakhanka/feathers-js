# Feathers:

## what is it:

- Framework built on top of express
- help built REST APIs quickly with minial boilerplate
- especially well suited for modern apps that need websocket, real time functionality or rapid development

## difference between feathers and express

| Feature           | Feathers                                      | Express                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Base purpose      | Build real time APIs and services             | general purpose webframework              |
| built on          | express                                       | native Nodejs                             |
| real time support | in-built through socket.io and Primus         | not built-in, requires manual integration |
| crud APIs         | autogenerated via : feathers generate service | manual implementation                     |

## What is special about feathers

- Service oriented architecture - everything is 'service' with standard methods like: find, get, create, update etc.
- Real time by default - automatic syncing with clients over websockets
- autogenerated REST APIs - just definde service and get the REST and Websocket endpoints
- Pluggable adapters- to easily connect to MongoDb, postgres, mysql
- out of the box authentication: JWT, Oauth2 etc
- automatically maps the service to endpoints and expose it over websockets if enabled

Featherjs = Express + Real time capabilities + service structure + rapid development
